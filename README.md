The DriverPass project was a project that involved minimal upkeeping. The client's vision was to create a website that hosts up-to-date state and local driving policies, which aids the students to better prepare for their driving tests. The application also provides the student far beyond the computer screen. The website strives to provide the student with an onhand driving experience as they are better equipped when taking their road test. The application will be designed around the studying material to make them easy to comprehend. The student will be able to create, modify driving appointments. From an upkeeping perspective, all changes made to the server are logged and monitored by the ITadmin.  The secretary is able to book appointments for the student and make recommendations based on budgets and driver availability. 
If i could pick one part to revise, it would be the UML sequence diagram. I presented an overview of the use cases and did not go into detail. 
The best approach is collaboration and communication. In the driver pass example, there were a few meetings between the client and project manager to ensure the client's vision was understood and applied in the design.  As the website will be customer-facing, ease of use and functionality are the most significant attributes. I focused on the more minor details which would impact and improve the user experience.
